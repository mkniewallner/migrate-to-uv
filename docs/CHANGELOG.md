## 0.10.0 - 2026-01-16

### Breaking changes

#### Automatic selection of build backend

When migrating Poetry package distribution metadata, `migrate-to-uv` now automatically chooses the build backend to use based on the metadata complexity, prioritising [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/concepts/build-backend/) if it is simple enough, or using [Hatch](https://hatch.pypa.io/latest/config/build/) otherwise.

It is still possible to explicitly choose a specific build backend with `--build-backend hatch` or `--build-backend uv`, but if the latter is chosen and the package distribution metadata cannot be expressed with uv build backend, the migration will fail, suggesting to use `--build-backend hatch` instead.

### Features

* Abort migration early if uv executable is required but not found ([#558](https://github.com/mkniewallner/migrate-to-uv/pull/558))
* Improve dependencies locking wording ([#609](https://github.com/mkniewallner/migrate-to-uv/pull/609))

* [poetry] Choose build backend based on distribution complexity ([#597](https://github.com/mkniewallner/migrate-to-uv/pull/597))
* [poetry] Automatically add Python classifiers for packages based on `python` specifier ([#606](https://github.com/mkniewallner/migrate-to-uv/pull/606))
* [poetry] Add lower and upper bounds to `uv_build` ([#617](https://github.com/mkniewallner/migrate-to-uv/pull/617))
* [poetry] Enable namespace for packages without `__init__.py` on uv build backend ([#631](https://github.com/mkniewallner/migrate-to-uv/pull/631))
* [poetry] Use more concise warnings output ([#632](https://github.com/mkniewallner/migrate-to-uv/pull/632))

## 0.9.1 - 2025-12-24

### Bug fixes

* [poetry] Fail migration on missing `__init__.py` for uv build backend ([#553](https://github.com/mkniewallner/migrate-to-uv/pull/553))

## 0.9.0 - 2025-12-22

### New features

#### Experimental support for uv build backend

When migrating Poetry package distribution metadata, `migrate-to-uv` uses [Hatch](https://hatch.pypa.io/latest/config/build/) build backend. Experimental support for migrating to uv build backend has been added behind `--build backend-uv` argument.

Note that uv build backend offers less flexibility than Poetry and Hatch, so the migration might be aborted if some options used by Poetry cannot be expressed with uv build backend. If you try `--build-backend uv` and encounter any issue, feel free to report it.

### Features

* [poetry] Add experimental `--build-backend uv` argument to migrate package distribution metadata to uv build backend ([#533](https://github.com/mkniewallner/migrate-to-uv/pull/533))

### Bug fixes

* [poetry] Do not migrate `packages`/`include` with empty `format` array ([#538](https://github.com/mkniewallner/migrate-to-uv/pull/538))
* [poetry] Fail migration on unhandled python marker specification ([#544](https://github.com/mkniewallner/migrate-to-uv/pull/544))

## 0.8.1 - 2025-12-13

### Bug fixes

* [poetry] Fail on unhandled version specifications ([#514](https://github.com/mkniewallner/migrate-to-uv/pull/514))
* [poetry] Also check if `poetry.lock` exists when checking if a project uses Poetry ([#528](https://github.com/mkniewallner/migrate-to-uv/pull/528))

## 0.8.0 - 2025-11-17

### Breaking changes

#### Abort on unrecoverable errors and warn about recoverable ones

Although `migrate-to-uv` tries its best to migrate a project to uv without changing the behavior, some things that are accepted by package managers do not have any equivalent in uv. Previously, `migrate-to-uv` would warn about the issue, but still perform the migration. It now aborts the migration in case it is not able to perform the migration that would result in behavior changes when migrating to uv.

If errors occur and lead to aborting the migration, you are expected to manually update your setup and retry the migration.

Warnings that occurred during the migration (which did not break the behavior) are now also grouped and displayed at the very end of the migration.

### Features

* feat!: abort on unrecoverable errors and warn about recoverable ones ([#480](https://github.com/mkniewallner/migrate-to-uv/pull/480))
* [poetry] Do not set optional groups as default ones ([#299](https://github.com/mkniewallner/migrate-to-uv/pull/299))
* Indicate support for Python 3.14 ([#468](https://github.com/mkniewallner/migrate-to-uv/pull/468))

### Bug fixes

* [poetry] Use inclusion when converting `^x.y` versions ([#466](https://github.com/mkniewallner/migrate-to-uv/pull/466))
* [poetry] Properly convert `include` to Hatch's build backend ([#477](https://github.com/mkniewallner/migrate-to-uv/pull/477))
* [poetry] Do not crash on empty `readme` array ([#481](https://github.com/mkniewallner/migrate-to-uv/pull/481))
* [poetry] Abort migration on dependencies using `||` operator, as there is no PEP 440 equivalent ([#487](https://github.com/mkniewallner/migrate-to-uv/pull/487))
* [poetry] Handle versions that use Poetry style and `,`, like `^1.0,!=1.1.0` ([#489](https://github.com/mkniewallner/migrate-to-uv/pull/489))
* [pip/pip-tools] Suggest how to add dependencies that could not be converted ([#350](https://github.com/mkniewallner/migrate-to-uv/pull/350))
* Preserve comments for sections unrelated to migration ([#471](https://github.com/mkniewallner/migrate-to-uv/pull/471))

## 0.7.3 - 2025-06-07

### Bug fixes

* Use correct `include-group` name to include groups when using `--dependency-groups-strategy include-in-dev` ([#283](https://github.com/mkniewallner/migrate-to-uv/pull/283))
* [poetry] Handle `=` single equality ([#288](https://github.com/mkniewallner/migrate-to-uv/pull/288))

### Features

* Add `--skip-uv-checks` to skip checking if uv is already used in a project ([#118](https://github.com/mkniewallner/migrate-to-uv/pull/118))

### Bug fixes

* [pip/pip-tools] Warn on unhandled dependency formats ([#103](https://github.com/mkniewallner/migrate-to-uv/pull/103))
* [pip/pip-tools] Ignore inline comments when parsing dependencies ([#105](https://github.com/mkniewallner/migrate-to-uv/pull/105))
* [poetry] Migrate scripts that use `scripts = { callable = "foo:run" }` format instead of crashing ([#138](https://github.com/mkniewallner/migrate-to-uv/pull/138))

## 0.6.0 - 2025-01-20

Existing data in `[project]` section of `pyproject.toml` is now preserved by default when migrating. If you prefer that the section is fully replaced, this can be done by setting `--replace-project-section` flag, like so:

```bash
migrate-to-uv --replace-project-section
```

Poetry projects that use PEP 621 syntax to define project metadata, for which support was added in [Poetry 2.0](https://python-poetry.org/blog/announcing-poetry-2.0.0/), are now supported.

### Features

* Preserve existing data in `[project]` section of `pyproject.toml` when migrating ([#84](https://github.com/mkniewallner/migrate-to-uv/pull/84))
* [poetry] Support migrating projects using PEP 621 ([#85](https://github.com/mkniewallner/migrate-to-uv/pull/85))

* [pipenv] Delete `Pipfile.lock` after migration ([#66](https://github.com/mkniewallner/migrate-to-uv/pull/66))
* Exit if uv is detected as a package manager ([#61](https://github.com/mkniewallner/migrate-to-uv/pull/61))

### Bug fixes

* Ensure that lock file exists before parsing ([#67](https://github.com/mkniewallner/migrate-to-uv/pull/67))

### Documentation

* Explain how to set credentials for private indexes ([#60](https://github.com/mkniewallner/migrate-to-uv/pull/60))

## 0.4.0 - 2025-01-17

When generating `uv.lock` with `uv lock` command, `migrate-to-uv` now keeps the same versions dependencies were locked to with the previous package manager (if a lock file was found), both for direct and transitive dependencies. This is supported for Poetry, Pipenv, and pip-tools.

This new behavior can be opted out by setting `--ignore-locked-versions` flag, like so:

```bash
migrate-to-uv --ignore-locked-versions
```

### Features

* Keep locked dependencies versions when generating `uv.lock` ([#56](https://github.com/mkniewallner/migrate-to-uv/pull/56))

## 0.3.0 - 2025-01-12

Dependencies are now locked with `uv lock` at the end of the migration, if `uv` is detected as an executable. This new behavior can be opted out by setting `--skip-lock` flag, like so:

```bash
migrate-to-uv --skip-lock
```

### Features

* Lock dependencies at the end of migration ([#46](https://github.com/mkniewallner/migrate-to-uv/pull/46))

## 0.2.1 - 2025-01-05

### Bug fixes

* [poetry] Avoid crashing when an extra lists a non-existing dependency ([#30](https://github.com/mkniewallner/migrate-to-uv/pull/30))

### Bug fixes

* [pipenv] Correctly update `pyproject.toml` ([#19](https://github.com/mkniewallner/migrate-to-uv/pull/19))
